Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
--> We call python is high -level programming language because it is very easylly
    understandable by humans.python is called general purpose because other than 
    application development and data science it is adopded by accounts and many other
    purpose to get it done.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
--> python is called a dynamically typed language beacuse we dont initialise the 
    variable type during code writting. it automatically detect the data type 
    during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
  --> PROS= 
            -Firstlly it is a bignner friendlly Language.
            -it have very Extencive Library collection.
            - It highly Scalable.

     Cons->
            -It is slower than Compile language.
            -Security is lower than other language.
            -Pythone comes with high  memory consumtion.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
 --> Pyhton is mainly popular for Machine learning and artificial intelligence
     and Data science.other than that it can be used for web devlopment,
     Gaming development,Application development.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
--> The name given to the sstorage is variable . Variables are those in which we 
    store items.Usully we declaire them with giving them the data type and assign
    some value but in case of python we did not give the data type to variable
   only assign some value to it . during runtime python get to that it is a variable.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
--> The "input()" function is sed to take input in the python Like-
    A=int(input("Give  the first value:-"))
    B=int (input("Give the second value:-"))
    C=A+B
    print(C)

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using
    input() function?
--> The default "input()" function return String.

Q8. What is type casting?
--> Converting one Varible data type to other is called type Casting Like->
    a =16
    a =float(a)
    print(a)
    
    output-16.0
    

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function?
    If yes, how? If no, why?
--> yes, there are two ways that in pythone we can take more that one input uing only
    single input() function . like->
   1- using split() function
   2- using list Comprehension 
 

ex- (i)-a,b,c =input("Give the values to variables:-").split()
       print(a)
       print(b)

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
--> Indentation is the space given befor specific keyword that it shows that it is
    continuation of or inside another command.Usually it is 4 spaces but more can be
   used. like- 
               for x in list1:
                   print(x)

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
-->We can throw Output in a python with use of "print" keyword.
   ex- list2=["Rahul","Banana","Cherry","Pen"]
       print(list2)

Q14. What are operators in Python?
--> Operators are those which is use to some calculation and operation between
    two or more numeric values.Like-> +,-,/,%,+=,-=,/=,%= etc
    ex- a=4
        b=2
        print(a+b)
        print(a-b)
        print(a/b)
        print(a%)
     

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
-->  "/" operator is divition operator it simply divide two numerical value and give the value and
     it can also give output as decimal.
     "//" operator is a Floor division operator which not only divides but give the minimum value after 
      divition it doesnt includes dicimal part.like-if normaloutput is 7.5 it will give only 7.

--> Conditional statements are those by which we can provide conditons in the code.
    The keywords are used to provide conditions in the code are -if,elsea nd else.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
-->   'if', 'elif' and 'else' are the eywords which is used as conditional statement in 
      the code in python.
      like if we have written the code using these three keywords then the code will go like these
      first it will go to 'if 'statement if that statisfy the condion code will excicute if not satisfied
      the it will go to elif if that statisfy the condion code will excicute if not satisfied
      the it will go to else statement and finishes the code.

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
--> tuple is used to have diffrent type and in many numbers of data in a single
    varible. It is ordered,unchangeble and allow duplicate values.
    it is different for list because it is unchangeble.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
--> To create tuple we have to have one variable and data should be stored in a 
    parantesis.like-

    tuple1=(123,"123","Ajay",True)

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it?
     Support your answer with reason.
-->  Directly tuple cant changed and name or other things cant be added because of
     its unchangeble properties but with the help of type this ca be done so like-
     
     tuple1=(123,"123","Ajay",True)
     tuple_to_list=list(tuple1)
     tuple_to_list.append("Rahul")

      like if we use update it only change the value at specifice index but add()
      is use to append value to set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
-->  clear() is used to remove all the items present in a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?

    set_b={6,7,8,2,3}
    set_a.intersection(set_b)

output -->{2,3}
